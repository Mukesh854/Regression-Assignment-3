    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in regression analysis to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity and overfitting.The main difference between Ridge Regression and ordinary least squares regression lies in how they handle multicollinearity and overfitting. While OLS tends to give high-variance estimates when multicollinearity is present, Ridge Regression provides more stable estimates by adding a penalty term to the objective function, thus reducing the impact of multicollinearity and overfitting."
